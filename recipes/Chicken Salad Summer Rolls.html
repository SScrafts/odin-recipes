    <img src="summer.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced red onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced celery</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>6 small rice paper sheets</li>
        <li>12 slices ripe avocado</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced red bell pepper strips</li>
        <li>½ medium English cucumber, cut into strips</li>
        <li>½ cup julienned carrot</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped hearts of romaine lettuce</li>

      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix chicken, red onion, celery, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, cumin, and mayonnaise until well blended. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, dip a rice paper into cold water and let soak just until it starts to become flexible. Shake off most of the excess water and lay on a work surface. Place 2 slices of avocado in the center of the wrapper, about 1 inch in from the edge closest to you. Layer with bell pepper, cucumber, and carrot, spread about 1/4 cup chicken salad over top, and cover with lettuce.</li>
        <li>Grab the end of the wrapper closest to you and roll it up, gently stretching the flexible rice paper while tucking in the sides. Wet a second wrapper and wrap it around the first. Wrap the summer roll in barely damp paper towels and cover with plastic while you make the remaining 5 rolls.
        </li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, lemon juice, tarragon, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper together for dipping sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve summer rolls with dipping sauce on the side.</li>
      </ol>
